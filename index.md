# About Me
**Hi!   I'm _Emi Dreckmeyr_**

I'm a PhD student enrolled in the [STIC](https://univ-cotedazur.fr/recherche-innovation/doctorat-phd/ecoles-doctorales/stic) doctoral school at the [DS4H graduate school](https://ds4h.univ-cotedazur.eu/) of Université Côte d’Azur. I'm a member of the [COATI](https://team.inria.fr/coati/) project joint-team between [Inria centre at Université Côte d’Azur](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-centre-universite-cote-azur) and the [I3S Laboratory](https://www.i3s.unice.fr/en/) under the co-supervision of [Christelle Caillouet](http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Christelle.Molle-Caillouet/) and [Nathalie Mitton](http://researchers.lille.inria.fr/~mitton/).

I consider myself as a hard-working, dynamic individual with fast learning capabilities and the ability to work both independently and collaboratively in a variety of settings. Throughout high school, I consistently maintained a position in the Top 10 academic group while participating in numerous extracurricular activities. In university, I was a member of several extracurricular committees and sports teams for my campus residence. At the completion of my Bachelor of Engineering degree, I achieved a 70% average for my final year and honors for my final year project. At the completion of my Master of Engineering degree, I graduated cum laude. I strongly believe in leading by example and demonstrating how seemingly ordinary situations can be handled with compassion, dedication, and care.
